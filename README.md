# hattrick_libs

This is a library to transform xml-data from the API of the infamous online-strategy-game hattrick (https://www.hattrick.org) into python objects.

As this was just intended to be a python-learning-project and to be the ground-work for another hattrick-project of mine initially,
(https://hattrick-fun-with-flags.app), hattick_libs doesn't aim to be complete nor useful to any other purpose than it was originally built for.

If you are looking for a complete python library for hattrick.org consider also pyCHPP of Pierre Gobin. His project was there before mine and 
looks quite sophisticated to me. It's implemented in an object-oriented style and thus well readable and clean. Compared to pyCHPP, hattrick_libs is a 
very basic implementation of the hattrick-API. But consider also this: If you are a learner like myself, hattrick_libs will be a perfect opportunity
to get your hands dirty on some cool python stuff without having to learn oop first. Or you decide to implement your own flavor of a hattick library 
in python and let yourself inspire by both this projects. There is room for all of us. Whatever your decision is: make sure to connect. Refer to the
"Contact" section of this document if you can help improve hattrick_libs, have suggestions, if you want to adopt it to your needs or if you just feel 
like having a chat with another nerdy hattrick manager.

Have fun!:)

## Project state
